# Vulnerability Analysis â€“ Kioptrix 1 VM

## Objective
Identify and exploit vulnerabilities in a simulated environment using penetration testing techniques.

## Tools
Kali Linux, Nmap, Nikto, Dirb, Netcat

## Methodology

1. **Network Discovery**  
   Used `nmap -p- -A 192.168.56.103` to identify open ports, services, and OS fingerprinting.

2. **Service Enumeration**  
   Ran Nikto and Dirb to enumerate web server vulnerabilities and hidden directories.

3. **Exploit Research**  
   Searched for known exploits using Metasploit and online CVE databases based on identified services.

4. **Exploitation**  
   Launched Metasploit, selected appropriate modules, and executed payloads to gain shell access.

5. **Privilege Escalation**  
   Escalated privileges by exploiting kernel vulnerabilities and created a persistent user account.

6. **Documentation & Mitigation**  
   Documented findings, mapped CVEs, and proposed mitigation strategies, including patching, MFA, and network segmentation.

HOW I GAINED ACCESS
I used the nmap -p- -A <Kioptrix IP> 192.168.56.103 to identify services and potential vulnerabilities. Next, look for known exploits for the services identified search engines like Metasploit, launched Metasploit and searched for the exploit:
msfconsole
search [service_name]
use exploit/[exploit_path]
set RHOST 192.168.56.103
run
Once I gained access, I established persistence by creating a new user (ELUE).

Mitigation Techniques to Secure the System
     Regular Software Updates:
- Ensure all software and services are updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
      Strong Authentication Mechanisms:
-	Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security.
-	Use strong, unique passwords and change them regularly.
Least Privilege Principle:
-	Ensure users have only the permissions necessary for their roles.
-	Regularly review and adjust user permissions.
Account Lockout Policies:
-	Implement account lockout policies after a set number of failed login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):
-	Deploy IDPS to detect and prevent unauthorized access attempts.
-	Monitor system logs and alerts for suspicious activities.
Network Segmentation:
-	Segregate critical systems from less secure parts of the network to limit the spread of an attack.
Security Audits and Penetration Testing:
-	Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
Hardened Configurations:
-	Disable unnecessary services and ports.
-	Use firewalls to restrict access to critical services.
User Training and Awareness:
-	Educate users about common social engineering attacks and phishing schemes.
-	Promote best practices for cybersecurity hygiene.

## Key Takeaways
- Discovered open ports and vulnerable services  
- Gained root access via manual exploitation  
- Documented CVEs and proposed remediation
- Gained experience in footprinting, scanning, and privilege escalation
