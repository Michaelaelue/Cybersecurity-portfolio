# Vulnerability Scanning with Nessus & Greenbone

## Objective
To perform vulnerability scans on Metasploitable VMs using Nessus and Greenbone, compare results, and propose remediation strategies.

## Tools & Technologies
- Nessus
- Greenbone Security Assistant (OpenVAS)
- Metasploitable 1 & 2
- CVE Analysis

## Methodology & Screenshots

**Environment Setup**  
   Deployed Metasploitable 1 & 2 VMs and ensured network connectivity with scanning tools.

**Nessus Scan Execution**  
   Configured scan policies in Nessus, ran full vulnerability scans, and exported results for analysis.

**Greenbone Scan Execution**  
   Ran parallel scans using Greenbone Security Assistant (OpenVAS) with similar configurations.

**Result Comparison**  
   Compared CVE findings, severity ratings, and detection gaps between Nessus and Greenbone.

**Risk Prioritization**  
   Categorized vulnerabilities by severity and exploitability. Created a prioritized remediation plan.

6. **Reporting & Insights**  
   Documented scan outputs, tool performance differences, and recommended layered security controls.
