# Intrusion Detection with Snort IDS

## Objective
To Configure and tune Snort IDS to detect common attack patterns such as port scans and brute-force attempts. This project demonstrates my ability to work with intrusion detection systems and map alerts to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.

## Tools & Technologies
- Snort IDS
- Kali Linux
- Wireshark
- MITRE ATT&CK Framework

## Methodology & Screenshots

### 1. Snort Configuration
Configured Snort with custom rules to detect suspicious activity.

## Findings
- Successfully detected multiple attack types
- Reduced false positives through rule tuning
- Gained insight into threat behavior using MITRE mapping

## Key Takeaways
- Strengthened IDS configuration and alert analysis skills
- Learned how to align detection with threat intelligence frameworks
